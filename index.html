<h2 align="center">Best IT Solution in Market</h2>
<p> The product versus solution distinction extends back to the 1970s, when VARs emerged. At that time, the rise of microcomputers moved computing beyond the glass house and out to other departments, such as manufacturing and engineering. In response, VARs bundled software -- their own or a third-party package -- with a particular hardware platform and sold the bundle as a turnkey solution designed specifically for a particular use case. Frequently, such hardware/software solutions targeted customers in niche vertical markets.
